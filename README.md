Idea: Play a sound and snap a picture with webcam to see if my dog came looking for me when I'm not around.
Implementation as follow. Project uses AForge libraries for webcam picture-snapping. 
Their license can be found under http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/license.html

Results of all this? My dog don't give a f apparently :) Not once was she snapped on camera.

You are free to do with this as you wish. No limitations.
